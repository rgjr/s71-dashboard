### General Notes
- Used Create React App as requested
- Installed `semantic-ui-react`
- Used the `fetch` function as a utility to retrieve API data in a promise
- Separated out the 2 main `entity_type` and used that as a springboard for grouping together components
- Tried to use as much of the metadata as I could for `video` and `feed` types, such as linking to the youtube videos or youtube user pages

### Would Liked To Have Done
- Add a navbar or
- Add a sidebar
- Include `d3.js` to show visual changes from the JSON objects that held percentage changes
- Add `react-router` to separate out the containers into their own pages
- Separate out some of the logic inside the `Timeline.js` component a little more to have the data parsed out on the backend, instead of inside the component
- Add modals for displaying a larger version of the videos instead of the mini sized versions
